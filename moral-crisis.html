    <h1>It’s a Moral Issue</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p>We tell ourselves we care about the planet, but our lifestyles tell a different story. We drive solo to the store, fly across the country for a weekend getaway, and toss leftovers into the trash — not because we are evil, but because we are accustomed to comfort. This moral crisis is rooted not in malice, but in habit and indifference. It is the tragedy of good people participating in destructive systems. As ethicist Adam Briggle argues, climate change forces us to confront how we live, what we value, and what we owe future generations.</p>
      <p>We must ask: How can we say we love our children while bequeathing them a hotter, more hostile planet? Every ton of CO₂ released is a theft from their future. This is no longer just about carbon footprints — it’s about moral footprints. Our actions today carve consequences into tomorrow. To delay is to choose convenience over conscience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <p>But there is hope — if we can see clearly. Philosopher Kathleen Dean Moore writes that ethical clarity arises when the smoke of denial is lifted. Once we see climate change not just as a technical glitch but a human failing, we can act with purpose. Our choices become moral acts: biking instead of driving, voting for climate policy, reducing meat consumption. These are not sacrifices — they are expressions of care.</p>
      <p>History will judge our generation by whether we had the courage to recognize this crisis for what it truly is. Not just a planetary emergency, but a test of our moral imagination. To rise to the occasion means realigning our lives with what we know to be right. The time for passive awareness is over. What remains is the call to act — bravely, collectively, and ethically.</p>
