    <h1>Bringing Climate Ethics into the Classroom</h1>

    <p>My interview with Professor Sam Mickey revealed how reframing climate change as a moral and justice-based issue, rather than just a scientific one, can inspire deeper awareness and personal responsibility among students. Professor Mickey has taught at USF for 17 years and has spent the last four specifically focused on his climate ethics class, which he designed to center climate change not as a scientific puzzle, but as a moral crisis.</p>

    <p>One of the key takeaways from our conversation was his belief that raising awareness through personal and ethical framing is more impactful than relying solely on statistics. “We are the future generations people warned about decades ago,” he explained. “And now the crisis is already unfolding.” His approach to teaching uses rhetorical strategies like framing and strategic empathy to help students recognize their role in the crisis — and more importantly, their ability to be part of the solution.</p>

    <h2>Climate Change as a Justice Issue</h2>
    <p>Professor Mickey emphasizes that the most pressing ethical concern in climate change is justice. The people and nations contributing the least to the crisis are the ones suffering the most. He draws attention to communities in regions like Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East that are already on the verge of uninhabitability. As heat and disaster drive people to migrate, he warns of a growing humanitarian challenge that wealthier countries must face responsibly.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Empathy and Relevance</h2>

    <p>Psychological distance is the sense that a problem is abstract or unconnected from you. Mickey combats this by encouraging students to connect the issue to things they care about. “If you love chocolate, you should care about climate change,” he tells them, highlighting how even the simple joys of life are at risk. This personalized, emotionally resonant strategy helps students see the crisis not as someone else's problem, but as one that affects their lives directly.</p>

    <p>By using strategic empathy, Mickey ensures that climate issues are not just understood, but felt. This shift from abstract knowledge to emotional relevance is crucial in motivating actual behavior change — a shift he believes is the cornerstone of real advocacy.</p>

    <h2>Simplicity as a Moral Virtue</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the interview was his insistence that we already have the solutions. What’s missing is the will to change how we live. He advocates for a cultural shift toward simplicity — not as a sacrifice, but as a choice to live more meaningfully and responsibly. “Live simply,” he says, “so that others may simply live.”</p>
